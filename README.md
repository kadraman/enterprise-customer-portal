# Enterprise Customer Portal

## ⚠️ WARNING
**This application contains intentional security vulnerabilities and should NEVER be deployed to production or exposed to the internet.**  
This is for educational and demonstration purposes only.

## Overview

This is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates various security vulnerabilities that can be detected by application security testing tools such as those provided by [OpenText Application Security](https://www.opentext.com/products/application-security).

## Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.2.1
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 In-Memory Database
- Gradle 8.7
- React
- Tailwind CSS

Optional:
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) for Single Sign-On (SSO) and OAuth2 authentication
- MSAL.js (frontend) for Entra login and token handling
- Spring Security (backend) as OAuth2 resource server with Entra JWT validation

See [ENTRA_SETUP_GUIDE.md](docs/ENTRA_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for information on how to setup Login Authentication using Microsoft Entra.

## Intentional Security Vulnerabilities

This application includes the following intentional security vulnerabilities:

### 1. SQL Injection
- Unparameterized SQL queries in `UserService`
- Direct concatenation of user input in SQL statements

### 2. Path Traversal
- File operations without path validation in `FileService`
- Allows reading/writing arbitrary files on the system

### 3. Command Injection
- Direct execution of user-supplied commands in `FileService`
No input validation or sanitization

### 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Unescaped user input reflected in HTML responses
- No output encoding in `UserController`

### 5. Hardcoded Credentials/Secrets
- Hardcoded API keys in source code
- Hardcoded database credentials in `application.properties`
- Exposed secrets in configuration files

### 6. Weak Cryptography
- Use of MD5 for password hashing (cryptographically broken)
- Plain text password storage

### 7. Information Disclosure
- Exposure of stack traces to users
- Sensitive credentials exposed via API endpoints
- Database credentials accessible through debug endpoints

### 8. Insecure Authentication
- Weak password validation
- Plain text password comparison
- Password echoed back in login response

### 9. Insecure Payment Handling
- Storing full payment card PAN and CVV in plain text (`Payment` entity) - PCI/PII violation (INSECURE, demo only)
- Debug endpoints that return or log raw card numbers (`/api/payments/debug/rawcards`) — information disclosure
- No input validation or sanitization on payment inputs (allows malformed/attacker-controlled values)
- Missing access controls and audit for payment operations (debug endpoints expose sensitive data even with minimal auth)
- No encryption or tokenization for payment data at rest or in transit beyond default TLS (demo lacks proper PCI controls)

### 10. Insecure Entra / OAuth Token Handling
- Relaxed issuer validation fallback for Entra token exchange (accepts signature-valid token even when issuer claim mismatches) - INSECURE demo behavior
- Token exchange endpoint accepts externally obtained Entra access tokens and converts them to local demo JWTs with minimal claim hardening
- Frontend may fall back from custom API scope to `User.Read` when consent is unavailable, weakening intended API audience restrictions
- Auth artifacts are cached in browser localStorage, increasing exposure if XSS is present
- Audience (`aud`) and Authorized Party (`azp`) claims are not validated in token exchange
- Backend disables CSRF protection for authentication flows

### 11. Insecure Dependencies
- Frontend intentionally includes outdated dependencies in [frontend/package.json](frontend/package.json) for SCA demonstrations and supply-chain scanning:
   - `axios@0.21.0`
   - `lodash@4.17.15`
   - `minimist@0.0.8`
   - `node-forge@0.9.0`
- Backend intentionally includes vulnerable dependencies in [build.gradle](build.gradle) for SCA demonstrations and supply-chain scanning:
   - `commons-collections:commons-collections:3.2.1`
   - `com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.4.10`
   - `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.60`
- These dependencies are expected to be flagged by tools such as Sonatype Lifecycle, Fortify SCA, and similar scanners.
- Secure alternatives would be to upgrade to maintained versions or remove the dependencies entirely if they are not needed.

## Building the Application

```bash
# Linux/UNIX example
./gradlew clean build
```

## Running the Application

```bash
# Linux/UNIX example
./gradlew bootRun

# or run the jar file:
java -jar build/libs/enterprise-customer-portal-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

# or run with Docker Compose (recommended)
docker compose up --build -d
```

The application frontend UI will then be available on `http://localhost:8080`, or you can browse to the backend API at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

### Docker Compose + Entra Variables

When running with Docker Compose, the frontend is built into static assets during image build. This means frontend Entra settings are read at build time from `frontend/.env.local` (via `--env-file`) and passed as Docker build args.

Expected frontend variables in `frontend/.env.local`:

```dotenv
ENTRA_CLIENT_ID=<frontend-client-id>
ENTRA_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
ENTRA_AUTHORITY=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>
ENTRA_API_SCOPES=api://<backend-client-id>/access_as_user
ENTRA_API_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080
ENTRA_POPUP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/auth-popup.html
```

Backend token validation uses `ENTRA_TENANT_ID` at runtime. You can set this in your root `.env` file or pass it from your shell.

Quick pairing setup for Docker Compose:

```bash
# root backend runtime variable
cp .env.example .env

# frontend build-time variables are read from this file
docker compose --env-file frontend/.env.local up --build -d
```

## Running Playwright End-to-End Tests

Playwright is used for E2E testing of the frontend (React) application. These tests simulate real user workflows and validate the UI and API integration.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- All backend and frontend dependencies installed (`npm install` in `frontend/`)
- Backend server running (or use Docker Compose)

### How to Run Tests

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run Playwright tests:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```
   This will execute all tests in `frontend/tests/`.

### HAR File Generation
- When you run the workflow test, a HAR file of all network traffic is generated at `etc/network.har` in the repo root.
- This can be analyzed with tools like Chrome DevTools or HAR viewers.

### Screenshots & Debugging
- Screenshots are saved in `frontend/tests/screenshots/` for each major workflow step.
- If a test fails, Playwright will also save a trace for debugging.

### Customizing Test Users
- By default, tests use the seeded user: `user` / `password`.
- You can override credentials with environment variables:
  ```bash
  E2E_USERNAME=myuser E2E_PASSWORD=mypass npx playwright test
  ```

### More Info
- See `frontend/tests/workflow.spec.ts` for the main E2E workflow.
- See Playwright docs: https://playwright.dev/docs/test-intro

## Developing the Application

If you wish to develop new features for the application you can start the backend and frontend up separately. To start the backend (without frontend):

```
# Linux/UNIX example
./gradlew clean bootRun -PskipFrontend=true
```

Then to start the frontend:

```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Note: if you make changes to the frontend the vite server will automatically reload. However, for changes to the backend you will need to stop and start the backend.

## API Documentation

After starting the application (see [Running the Application](#running-the-application)), the OpenAPI JSON and Swagger UI are available at:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
- OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`

Notes:
- These docs describe the intentionally insecure endpoints in this demo application.
- If you change the server port, update the host/port in the URLs above accordingly.
- The Swagger UI and OpenAPI JSON remain publicly accessible even when Entra integration is enabled.
- Protected `/api/**` operations still require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header when you use `Try it out`.
- You can keep using the API the same way as before by logging in via `/api/users/login` to obtain the demo JWT, then pasting that token into the Swagger **Authorize** dialog.

## Creating the JWT

The `/api/users/login` endpoint returns a raw JWT token on successful authentication. Use the token in an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to call protected endpoints (all `/api/**` except `/api/users/login` and `/api/users/debug/credentials`).

Examples (replace username/password with valid demo credentials):

### curl (bash / Linux / macOS):

```bash
# obtain token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/users/login?username=alice&password=alice456")
echo "Token: $TOKEN"

# call a protected endpoint
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8080/api/users"
```

### PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
# obtain token
$token = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/users/login?username=alice&password=alice456"
Write-Host "Token: $token"

# call a protected endpoint
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/users" -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token" }
```

Notes:
- The token returned by the demo is intentionally insecure (hard-coded secret and demo claims). Do not reuse in production.
- If your server port differs, update the URLs accordingly.

Seeded demo users:

- `alice` / `alice456` (see [src/main/java/com/opentext/appsec/demo/DataInitializer.java](src/main/java/com/opentext/appsec/demo/DataInitializer.java#L1-L25))

## Testing with Postman & Newman

You can test the REST API interactively with Postman or run the collection from the command line using `newman`.

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (v14+)

Run the included Postman collection (uses `{{baseUrl}}` collection variable, default `http://localhost:8080`):

```bash
# run with npx (no global install required)
npx newman run etc/ECP.postman_collection.json
```

If you want HTML output (install reporter locally or use npx):

```bash
npx newman run etc/ECP.postman_collection.json -r cli,html
# The HTML report will be written to the current folder (newman-run-report.html)
```

Notes:
- The `Auth - Login` request uses the seeded `admin` / `admin123` credentials and stores the JWT in a collection variable named `token`.
- Subsequent requests use the header `Authorization: Bearer {{token}}`.

## Testing with OpenText Application Security (Fortify)

This application is designed to be scanned with OpenText Application Security's SAST, SCA and DAST engines as well as AI remediation using Aviator.

Most of the vulnerabilities described above should be detected during static analysis. 

You can use the [Postman collection](etc/ECP.postman_collection.json) provided to run a DAST API scan.

You can use the [Login macro](etc/ECP-Dev-Login.webmacro) provided to run a DAST Website scan.

Note: the Login macro above sets the Logout condition URL to the custom logout endpoint used by this app:
```
[URI]/api/users/logout
```
This tells the scanner the application logout location so it can detect end-of-session events.

### Expected Findings

The security scan should identify:
- Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities
- Path Traversal vulnerabilities
- Command Injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded credentials and API keys
- Weak cryptographic algorithms
- Information disclosure issues
- Insecure authentication mechanisms
- Insecure storage and exposure of payment card data (plain-text PAN/CVV) — PCI/PII issues
- Endpoints that deliberately log or reflect sensitive payment data (information disclosure)
- OAuth / OpenID Connect token validation weaknesses in the Entra integration
- Weak claim validation and insecure token exchange behavior in the Entra login flow
